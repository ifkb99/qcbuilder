# QCBuilder
An online drag &amp; drop Quantum Circuit Builder. Heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Strilanc/Quirk">Quirk</a>.

QCBuilder is a web application which allows user to create small Quantum Circuits by dragging gates onto the workspace. Probability of the qubit being on is shown as how green the gate is. Moderate familiarity with Quantum Circuits is assumed. See a live demo at <a href="https://zackatoo.com/qcbuilder">zackatoo.com/qcbuilder</a>.

**Future Features**:
 - Export and Import Circuits from Qiskit code.
 - Export the circuit as an image.
 - More advanced gates.
 - Display qubit state using the Bloch Sphere.
